\section{Master File Table (MFT)}
\label{sec:MFT}
After analyzing how NTFS actually addresses storage, we will now look at how NTFS organizes the now available and addressable storage space. Like most modern file systems NTFS allow for organizing data using files and hierarchical directories. But with this structure there come some challenges: Where to store (meta-)data, the amount of files, that the depth of directories should not be limited, and a lot more. In the following section we will take a look at how NTFS aims to solve these problems.\\

	\caption{Conceptual design of MFT\label{fig:mft_concept}}
\end{figure}
In order to have a directory of files and directories, NTFS has a table-like structure, called the \textit{Master File Table} (\textit{MFT}). In this table, most rows will represent a single file or directory entry (technically the first few rows are different, but that shall not be in the scope of this report). This has been schematically illustrated in figure \ref{fig:mft_concept}. Before we get to how files and directories are stored, we will just take a look at how the MFT grows. The MFT is a file itself (and thus referenced within itself), located at \texttt{C:\textbackslash\$MFT}\footnote{Drive letter might differ}.\cite{RUSSINOVICH_ET_AL:2012:WI} As there is no predetermined maximum of files and directories that can be stored, the MFT needs to be able to grow dynamically. As the lookup times in the MFT should be rather low NTFS makes sure that whilst the MFT can grow that it is kept as contiguously stored on disk as possible. In order to do this NTFS will at first allocate $12.5\%$ of the available disk space and the release unused space, only once the disk has filled far enough for the space to be required. If the reserved amount of space should ever be exceed, more space will be allocated at a non-contiguous part of the disk. Unfortunately, due to MFT elements being referenced from potentially multiple places within the MFT, defragmentation cannot move MFT elements.\cite{microsoftinc:2018:HNR}. With all of this said, on a system with ``regular'' desktop usage the MFT is relatively small. On a volume with 500GB in use, the MFT size was approx. 1GB ($0.2$\% of total disk space).\\  Now that we know how the MFT grows, let's look at the data that actually occupies it. Generally a MFT Entry is represents one of two things: A file\footnote{N.B.: Windows, and hence NTFS do not employ the ``\textit{everything is a file}''-paradigm} or a directory. In the following we take a closer look at the structure of the aforementioned entry types.\\
\subsection{Storing files}
When it comes to files there is a lot of data that we would like to store: The actual data of the file, a filename, the creation date, the folder it is in and a lot more. Depending on the file though we might not always want to store the same metadata though. In order to account for this the MFT is not a table in a strict sense, as it does not have fixed columns in which data can be stored. Rather it works based on a concept called streams. Streams are, as the name suggest, just sequences of bytes. In order to enable full flexibility a MFT-Record can store an arbitrary amount of streams, that can contain various pieces of (meta-)data. In the following we will be taking a look at a few very common streams, the data they contain and how streams themselves are stored. Something interesting to note is that not only metadata, but also the actual data of a file is strictly speaking a stream. In figure \ref{fig:mft_entry} the layout of an example file with common data streams is shown. In the following we will look at the data streams that have been shown in figure \ref{fig:mft_entry}.

			\end{tabularx}
		\end{varwidth}
	}
	\caption{Example MFT file entry\label{fig:mft_entry}}
\end{figure}
The first attribute is always present in a file entry: \texttt{\$STANDARD\_INFORMATION}. This stream contains information such as \textit{read-only}, \textit{last-modified} and \textit{creation-time}. This data is important for any file an will hence always be present in an MFT entry.\cite{RUSSINOVICH_ET_AL:2012:WI}\\
The \texttt{\$FILE\_NAME} is a unicode\footnote{Excuding unicode characters reserved for other purposes, e.g., \texttt{\textbackslash}} name, which can have store as many as 255 characters.\cite{microsoftinc:2018:MFP} This is a limitation that serves to ensure that a  file name is  short enough to fit within an entry.
As security is out of scope for this paper we will not go to deep into the \texttt{security descriptor}. In short we can say  the attribute is used for access control.
Lastly the most interesting part of the a file. The \texttt{data}. In this stream all of the corresponding data to a file can be found.\\
%TODO: Rework next paragraph 
All of these attributes are part of our MFT entry. In a perfect world all of this data would just be kept within the MFT entry, but due to the sheer size of some files, the variability of possible streams stored and the fact that an MFT entry is only a fixed size (usually 1 KB\cite{B:2017:AJI}), at some point (meta-)data will need to be stored outside of the MFT. Up until the maximum record size is reached, all streams can be stored within the MFT record and can  be accessed very quickly.
\subsection{Referencing data}
As soon as the streams of a file exceed the given size limit, the Data stream of the file will be stored outside of the MFT. In order to accomplish this the data outside of the MFT is referenced (think of pointers for now). In the beginning of this report in section \ref{sec:Cluster}, we studied Clustering and how we can use it to address storage on the volume. With this information in mind the first naive idea would be to use as many clusters as we need, wherever they are free and store cluster numbers as ``pointers'' to each of them in the MFT entry. But unfortunately if we think of a very large file, the sheer number of pointers and the accompanying storage requirement would by far exceed feasibility. Hence NTFS is not referencing individual clusters, but rather multiple chunks of contiguous clusters, called extents. Extents are represented as a 3-tuple containing, the starting VCN, starting LCN and length. From the cluster identified by the starting VCN and LCN onwards, $l$ clusters are in the given extent. This means an extent $(s_v, s_l, l)$ is representing the following clusters:
\begin{center}
	$\{(c_v, c_l) \mid c_v, c_l \in \mathbb{N} \wedge c_v \in [s_v, s_v + l] \wedge c_l \in [s_l, s_l + l]\}$
\end{center}
where $c_v$ is the VCN and $c_l$ the LCN.\cite{miller:2013:CNS} An example of how to interpret an extent can be seen in figure \ref{fig:extent_basic}. In this figure the extent identified by the 3-tuple $(20, 60, 2)$, which means it has a length of two clusters and starts a the cluster identified VCN 20 and LCN 60. Hence the clusters $(20, 60)$ and $(21, 61)$ would be in the given extent and are marked green in the figure \ref{fig:extent_basic}.

	\caption{Example Extent\label{fig:extent_basic}}
\end{figure}
Going back to the problem of storing data outside of the MFT: NTFS will instead of referencing individuals cluster, as previously mentioned, extents. So if a file has a certain storage requirement NTFS will look for empty clusters and group contiguous ones into extents and will then reference these extents in the corresponding MFT entry. In figure \ref{fig:extent_file} an example for this is displayed. In the given example it is showcased how 2 MiB of data could be referenced using extents on a NTFS volume with 4 KiB clusters.
We can see that the total number of clusters in the extents sum up to 512 clusters which is the exact storage requirement. Furthermore we can observe that there is no gap in VCNs, all VCNs 0 through 511 are mapped. Mapping all VCNs from 0 through $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of clusters needed is always required, as VCNs are local to a file and represent offsets from the beginning (See section \ref{sec:Cluster:CN}). On the other hand, logical clusters are spread across the disk without a clear pattern.\cite{RUSSINOVICH_ET_AL:2012:WI} This implies that there might be a high degree of external fragmentation between the individual extents. That said the lack of locality restrictions allow for an easier allocation process and high degree of storage utilization.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Directories}
With the ability to store file the challenge of managing a directory structure arises. NTFS stores directories basically just like files, except for the fact that instead of storing data they store the identifiers of files, which can be looked up in the MFT. If all the references fit within an MFT entry then, as with file data, they will be stored in the entry linearly. Next to the identifiers, for the sake of reducing the number of lookups, file size (in number of clusters) and file names are also stored as file indices within the directory, to simplify listing and size computing. An example can be seen in figure \ref{fig:extent_file_indicies}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{
		\begin{varwidth}{0.95\columnwidth}

			\begin{tabularx}{0.95\columnwidth}{|X|X|X|}
				\hline
				Index & File name & Size in clusters\\
				\hline
				42 & \texttt{a.txt} & 512\\
				77 & \texttt{paper.tex} & 2037\\
				1097 & \texttt{code.c} & 963\\
				\hline
			\end{tabularx}
		\end{varwidth}
	}
	\caption{Example layout of file indices in a directory entry\label{fig:extent_file_indicies}}
\end{figure}
In case the files do not fit within the MFT entry, NTFS will again reference extents, only that these extents do not contain data, but rather file indices. That said these file indices are not just linearly in extents, but are rather stored as a tree. Which means that instead of storing only file indices there are also some value that are pointers to further file indices, as described above. In order to maintain a high speed of access the MFT tree structure is a \bplus{}-tree (a sorted tree), which allows for files to be located, added and deleted in \logn{}, where  $n$ is the number of entries. In figure \ref{fig:b-tree} it is conceptually shown how this works. The figure shows the index attribute of an example directory entry in an MFT. Here we can see a few things: For one files are stored in a sorted manner, this is an invariant of the \bplus{}-tree. Further we can see that this sorting is even upheld across the pointer structure. This allows for easy binary searching across the entire structure, which allows for the \logn{} operations. Please note: The number of files has been reduced for improved clarity of the diagram. In reality these few files would probably be stored linearly. Furthermore the referenced nodes of files could, generally speaking, also have pointers to nodes with files.
